### Phase 1 Backend Setup (October 18, 2025)
âœ… **SUPABASE SETUP COMPLETED**
- Database URL: `https://zrhdufpoigkhjtlgznkm.supabase.co`
- Successfully created all 9 tables with proper relationships and indexes
- Enabled Row-Level Security (RLS) with appropriate access policies
- Generated TypeScript types from Supabase schema (`types/database.ts`)
