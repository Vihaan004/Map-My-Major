## Key Features Implemented

### Real-Time Updates
Fixed the critical issue where UI wasn't updating after user actions. Now all operations update instantly:
- ✅ Adding semesters - appears immediately
- ✅ Adding classes - appears immediately with correct placement
- ✅ Changing class status - updates immediately
- ✅ Deleting classes - removes immediately with credit recalculation
- ✅ Deleting semesters - removes immediately
- ✅ Adding/editing/deleting courses in Course Bank - updates immediately

### Design Principles
- **Minimalistic**: Clean black and white theme with subtle gray accents
- **Small fonts**: 10px-14px for most text to accommodate dense information
- **Compact elements**: Minimal padding and spacing for efficiency
- **Responsive**: Grid layouts adapt to different screen sizes
- **Consistent**: Same design language across all pages

### Data Architecture
- Using Supabase directly (not Prisma) for database operations
- NextAuth with JWT sessions for authentication
- Local state management in client components for real-time updates
- Server components for initial data fetching

## Technical Implementation

### State Management Pattern
```tsx
// Instead of just calling router.refresh()
router.refresh(); // ❌ Doesn't update local state

// We now update local state immediately
const data = await response.json();
setClasses([...classes, data.class]); // ✅ Instant UI update
```

### Files Modified
1. `app/maps/[mapId]/MapClient.tsx` - Added local state updates for all operations
2. `app/courses/CourseBankClient.tsx` - Added local state for course management
3. `app/courses/page.tsx` - Created with Supabase integration
4. `app/account/page.tsx` - Created with user statistics
5. `.env` - Removed DATABASE_URL (not needed, using Supabase directly)

## Testing Results
All features tested with Playwright browser automation:
- ✅ Login flow
- ✅ Dashboard navigation
- ✅ Create map
- ✅ Add custom course to course bank
- ✅ View course bank with search/filter
- ✅ Open map
- ✅ Add semester (instant update confirmed)
- ✅ Add class from course bank (instant update confirmed)
- ✅ Change class status (instant update confirmed)
- ✅ Delete class (instant update confirmed)
- ✅ Add custom requirement
- ✅ View account page with statistics
- ✅ Navigate between pages

## Known Issues Fixed
1. ❌ **UI not updating after actions** → ✅ **Fixed** - Now using local state updates
2. ❌ **DATABASE_URL error** → ✅ **Fixed** - Removed Prisma dependency, using Supabase directly
3. ❌ **Router.refresh() not working** → ✅ **Fixed** - Implemented proper state management

## Next Steps (Phase 3+)
Future enhancements mentioned in requirements but not implemented yet:
- Drag and drop for reordering classes
- Edit class details inline
- Program templates from database
- AI assistant integration
- Advanced analytics and visualizations
- Multi-user collaboration features

## Conclusion
Phase 2 is complete with a fully functional, responsive UI that supports all core features. The application now provides instant feedback for all user actions, creating a smooth and efficient user experience.
