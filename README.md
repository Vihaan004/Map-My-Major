# MapMyMajor by Vihaan Patel
A Web App to plan, visualize, and track academic programs by creating interactive and customizable 'maps' coupled with advising support and college data integrations. Designed to assist students in organizing their academic journey effectively. 

---

Map My Major empowers students to create detailed academic plans by mapping out their courses and semesters in a tabular format. Our goal is to provide a simpler and instant visual representation of their program requirements and goals, abstracting away the complexities of traditional degree audits. We integrate a context-aware AI interaction to provide personalized academic advice and support for an alternative to traditional academic advising with long wait times.
